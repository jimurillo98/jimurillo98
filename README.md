- 👋 Hi, I’m Juan Ignacio Murillo Vargas! (Juan is fine!)
- 👀 My core teaching and research interests are in language and in ethics, both separately and jointly. This led me to study philosophy and linguistics as part of my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto, and I am currently pursuing
an MA in Philosophy (in Language & Linguistics) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. However, I'm also interested in learning more about NLP, and some of the linguistic and ethical issues that are associated with it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and some of the basics re: how it is applied for NLP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything language related, either on the theoretical side or (if my coding skills ever become good enough) on the technical side.
- 📫 How to reach me: TBD
